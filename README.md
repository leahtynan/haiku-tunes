# Haiku Tunes

*Work in progress!* Series of clues that build a musical haiku poem

I got excited about Wordle in early 2022 (which I played late at night, while taking care of my new daughter) and wanted to make a similar easy-to-play game. I have also, for quite some time, felt nostalgic about the fun I had working with music on my previous independent work <a href="https://github.com/leahtynan/magic-puzzles">Magic Puzzles</a>, and wondered if there was a way I could combine that with a word game.

The interaction for Haiku Tunes is as follows:
1. The user gets a clue for a word (like in a crossword puzzle, e.g. "Pok√©mon Gotta Catch 'Em ___")
2. When the user guesses the word correctly, a line of the haiku (containing the answer word) shows and a short musical phrase plays
3. After three words are entered correctly, the full haiku shows and the full song made up of the short musical phrases plays
