## Interaction
1. The user gets a clue for a word (like in a crossword puzzle, e.g. "Pokémon Gotta Catch 'Em ____"). The answer is a word from the first line of the poem.
2. When the user guesses the word correctly, a short musical phrase plays.
3. Repeat for the all three lines of the haiku.
4. After all three puzzles are solved, the full haiku shows and the full song made up of the short musical phrases plays.

## Content
Haiku Tunes features poetry (some donated from friends) on the themes of world peace and war as a reflection of the war in Ukraine that began around the same time I was brainstorming and planning out the game. In the game's art and music, I wanted to balance a portrayal of hopefulness and seriousness. Creating was a way to process the events going on in the world and it felt meaningful to — in however small a way — support peace and democracy. Content-wise, this is a new direction for me.

I created all the art assets and music, which are available as videos in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opqDVdZg43I&list=PLYJqFcgP0Aa6qZBGxYuZcd8l4_oI9-hK3&index=2">YouTube playlist</a>.

## Future Development
In the next phase of development, I will refactor this project to load all assets from outside Unity and provide the option to load different editions. Part of this work will involve creating/gathering assets for a nature poetry/photography edition to serve as the second edition. In this next edition, I imagine a "dark mode" (i.e. white text on black background) that would work with black and white photography and expand the theming capability of the software for future editions.

I would also like to add accessibility enhancements. A first step is describing the number of tiles on the screen for each puzzle (i.e. the number of letters the answer word has), which may be helpful for sighted users, as well. The clues can also be read aloud.
