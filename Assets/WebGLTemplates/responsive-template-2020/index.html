            <h2>Concept &amp; Process</h2>
            <h4><cite>Haiku Tunes</cite> (launched May 2021) is a digital puzzle experience that blends poetry, visual art, music, and game design.</h4>
            <p>The user solves a series of crossword puzzle-esque clues, revealing sample words from a haiku line-by-line. When correct answers for all three lines of the poem are given, the full haiku is revealed. Art and music accompany the experience, making it more immersive than a typical word game.</p>
            <p>This game has two sources of inspiration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I got excited about Wordle in early 2022 and wanted to make a similarly easy-to-play game.</li>
                <li>I've been nostalgic about the fun I had working with music and art on my previous independent work <a href="https://www.leahtynan.com/magic-puzzles">Magic Puzzles</a>, and wondered if there was a way I could combine music and art with a word game.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><cite>Haiku Tunes</cite> features poetry (some donated from friends) on the themes of world peace and war as a reflection of the war in Ukraine that began around the same time I was brainstorming and planning out the game. In the art and music, I wanted to balance a portrayal of hopefulness and seriousness. It was a meditative way to process the events going on in the world and produce a work of art in support of peace and democracy. Content-wise, this is a new direction for me.</p>
            <p>The structure of the art and music is based on the structure of haikus, which have three lines. Each line of the poem has a visual pattern (such as spirals or a set of ovals): the pattern is full-screen when solving the puzzle for a line, and when the full haiku is shown, the three patterns appear as panels in a triptych (going left to right). I came across a triptych project from my high school art portfolio class, which gave me the idea. Similarly, the music has three phrases which are first shown individually and then played together (plus some ad-libbing) when the full haiku is showing.</p>
            <p>The game can be re-skinned with other themes and perhaps other forms of visual art. I'm imagining something like a nature photography edition with Robert Frost-esque poems as the next edition.</p>

            <p>This work was created with the Unity game engine. Its C# code is open source on <a href="https://github.com/leahtynan/haiku-tunes" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>The music from the game is on YouTube in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opqDVdZg43I&list=PLYJqFcgP0Aa6qZBGxYuZcd8l4_oI9-hK3&index=1" target="_blank">Haiku Tunes playlist</a>.</p>
            <p>I worked on most of this game during my maternity leave. It was a great way to ease back into coding after the longest break I had taken from it &mdash; this in itself was inspiring and extremely encouraging. Check out my blog post <a href="https://leahtynan.com/blog/2022/04/11/gaming-and-coding-with-a-new-baby-at-home/">Gaming and Coding with a New Baby at Home</a> to learn more about this journey.</p>
            <p>Coming soon! I will post a series of Tweets with some technical tips from the development of this work.</p>
